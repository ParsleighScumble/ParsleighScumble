Hi, Iâ€™m @ParsleighScumble.

I'm currently looking for work. If you want to hire me, email parsleigh.scumble@proton.me. I'm in the United States, have six years of professional experience and more in open-source projects, and I'm open to contracting and full-time work in software engineering.

I'm especially interested in cryptography, art and graphics, but I also like backend web development and solving challenging problems!
